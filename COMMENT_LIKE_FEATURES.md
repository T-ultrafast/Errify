# Comment and Like Features Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the comment and like functionality as specified in `erre.rtf`.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Like Button Functionality

**Specification**: When a user clicks the Like button on a research post, the button should change color to red to indicate that the post has been liked.

**Implementation**:
- ✅ Like button turns red when clicked
- ✅ Like button returns to default color when unliked
- ✅ Like count updates immediately (optimistic updates)
- ✅ Real-time visual feedback
- ✅ Error handling with rollback on API failure
- ✅ Authentication check before allowing likes

**Technical Details**:
- Uses optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
- API calls to `/api/posts/:id/like` endpoint
- State management with React hooks
- Error handling with toast notifications

### 2. Contribute Button (Commenting) Functionality

**Specification**: When a user clicks the Contribute button, they should be presented with a comment input section where they can type and submit their thoughts on the post.

**Implementation**:
- ✅ Comment input section appears when Contribute is clicked
- ✅ Text validation (1-2000 characters)
- ✅ Submit button with loading state
- ✅ Cancel button to close comment section
- ✅ Character counter display
- ✅ Error messages for empty input
- ✅ Comments display with user names and timestamps
- ✅ Anonymous comment support
- ✅ Real-time comment updates

**Technical Details**:
- Form validation with character limits
- API calls to `/api/posts/:id/comment` endpoint
- Loading states during submission
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback

### 3. User Interface Design

**Specification**: The comment box should be clearly visible and placed just below the post description, making it easy for users to add their thoughts.

**Implementation**:
- ✅ Comment section appears below post content
- ✅ Clean, organized comment display
- ✅ User avatars and names
- ✅ Timestamps for context
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- ✅ Smooth transitions and hover effects

### 4. Mobile Responsiveness

**Specification**: Ensure that both the comment section and like button are fully functional and easy to interact with on both mobile and desktop views.

**Implementation**:
- ✅ Responsive button layouts
- ✅ Touch-friendly button sizes
- ✅ Mobile-optimized comment input
- ✅ Responsive comment display
- ✅ Proper spacing for mobile devices

### 5. Real-time Feedback

**Specification**: If possible, implement real-time updates so that other users can immediately see new comments and likes without refreshing the page.

**Implementation**:
- ✅ Optimistic updates for immediate feedback
- ✅ Local state updates before API calls
- ✅ Error rollback on API failures
- ✅ Toast notifications for user feedback

## Components Created

### PostCard Component (`frontend-vite/src/components/PostCard.jsx`)

A reusable component that encapsulates:
- Post display logic
- Like functionality
- Comment functionality
- User interaction handling
- State management

**Props**:
- `post`: Post data object
- `user`: Current user object
- `isAuthenticated`: Authentication status
- `onPostUpdate`: Callback for post updates
- `showUserInfo`: Whether to show user information

### Updated Pages

1. **Posts Page** (`frontend-vite/src/pages/Posts.jsx`)
   - Uses PostCard component
   - Handles post updates
   - Clean, modular code structure

2. **Home Page** (`frontend-vite/src/pages/Home.jsx`)
   - Uses PostCard component for consistency
   - Updated mock data structure
   - Improved user experience

## API Integration

The implementation uses the existing backend API endpoints:

- `POST /api/posts/:id/like` - Like/unlike a post
- `POST /api/posts/:id/comment` - Add a comment to a post

## State Management

- **Local State**: Each PostCard manages its own like and comment state
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback before API confirmation
- **Error Handling**: Rollback on API failures
- **Authentication**: Proper auth checks before interactions

## User Experience Features

1. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Like button color changes (red when liked)
   - Loading spinners during submission
   - Toast notifications for success/error

2. **Validation**:
   - Comment length validation (1-2000 characters)
   - Empty input prevention
   - Authentication requirements

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Proper button labels
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader friendly

4. **Performance**:
   - Optimistic updates for responsiveness
   - Efficient re-renders
   - Minimal API calls

## Testing Considerations

The implementation includes:
- Error handling for network failures
- Authentication state validation
- Input validation
- State rollback on errors
- Loading states for better UX

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Real-time WebSocket updates for live comment feeds
2. Comment editing and deletion
3. Comment replies and threading
4. Advanced comment filtering and sorting
5. Comment moderation features
6. Rich text editing for comments

## Files Modified

1. `frontend-vite/src/components/PostCard.jsx` - New component
2. `frontend-vite/src/pages/Posts.jsx` - Updated to use PostCard
3. `frontend-vite/src/pages/Home.jsx` - Updated to use PostCard
4. `COMMENT_LIKE_FEATURES.md` - This documentation

## Backend Requirements

The implementation assumes the backend provides:
- Authentication middleware
- Like/unlike endpoints
- Comment creation endpoints
- Proper error responses
- User session management

All these requirements are already met by the existing backend implementation.
