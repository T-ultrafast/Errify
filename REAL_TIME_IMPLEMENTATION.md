## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Backend Real-Time Updates

**Socket.IO Integration**:
- Enhanced `backend/routes/posts.js` with real-time event emission
- Updated `backend/server.js` to pass Socket.IO instance to routes
- Real-time events: `new_comment`, `post_liked`, `post_unliked`, `new_post`

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/posts/:id/like` - Like/unlike with real-time updates
- `POST /api/posts/:id/comment` - Add comment with real-time updates
- `GET /api/posts` - Fetch posts with comments
- `GET /api/posts/:id` - Get specific post with comments

### Frontend Real-Time Integration

**Socket.IO Client Service** (`frontend-vite/src/lib/socket.js`):
- Singleton Socket.IO client service
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Event listener management
- Post-specific room joining

**Enhanced PostCard Component**:
- Real-time comment updates
- Real-time like count updates
- Optimistic UI updates
- Proper cleanup on unmount

**App-Level Integration**:
- Socket.IO connection management in App component
- Connection based on authentication state
- Automatic disconnection on logout

## 🔄 Real-Time Flow

### Comment Flow:
1. User clicks "Contribute" button
2. Comment input appears
3. User types comment and clicks "Submit"
4. Optimistic update: comment appears immediately
5. API call to backend
6. Backend saves comment and emits `new_comment` event
7. All connected users receive real-time update
8. Comment appears for all users without refresh

### Like Flow:
1. User clicks "Like" button
2. Optimistic update: button turns red, count increases
3. API call to backend
4. Backend updates like and emits `post_liked` event

   - ✅ Like button should turn red immediately
   - ✅ Like count should update in both windows
5. **Add a comment** in one window
   - ✅ Comment should appear immediately
   - ✅ Comment should appear in both windows without refresh

### Testing Authentication:

1. **Log out** from the application
2. **Try to like a post**
   - ✅ Should show error message
   - ✅ Should redirect to login page
3. **Try to comment on a post**
